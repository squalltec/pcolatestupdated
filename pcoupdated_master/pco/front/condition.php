             <p><strong>Cancellation and Amendment Terms for:</strong><br>
            1. These terms govern all bookings made (whether through PCO &ndash; Connect web site or otherwise) with Pearl of Arabia Tourism L.L.C, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. All correspondence should be addressed to Pearl of Arabia Tourism L.LC, Deira Dubai. You accept these booking terms on behalf of all members of your party.</p>
            
            <p>2. Any booking made or order placed by you shall be deemed to be an offer by you to purchase the relevant accommodation and/or travel arrangements subject to these booking conditions. No contract between you and Pearl of Arabia shall come into existence until PCOConnect (a) issues a booking reference number; (b) issues a booking confirmation by email, fax or post; and (c) receives payment in full.</p>
            <p>3. Payment in full is required at the time of booking. Payment should be made through pcconnect.com’s web site by credit or debit card through Paypal or Wire Transfer. Where PCOConnect is unable to confirm the initial requested accommodation an alternative may be provided and an email notification will be sent to inform you of the details. The reservation will be held for 5 days in order for you to signify acceptance by making payment in full. Failure to make payment within 5 days of the booking confirmation for accommodation not available for immediate confirmation will result in automatic cancellation of the booking.</p>
            <p>4. Prices are shown in the currency requested with rates of exchange calculated on a daily basis. Prices may therefore differ on a daily basis to reflect any movement in exchange rate levels. When a booking is made the exchange rate will be fixed at the time the item is created and will apply to any amendments or cancellations to that item within the booking. Exchange rates are determined by PCO Connect.</p>
            <p>5. Bookings for travel arrangements will not be accepted less than 1 week prior to the date of arrival, unless the arrangements requested are shown as “Immediate” availability. </p>            <p>6. Hotels. Star ratings are used to symbolise the overall quality, level of service, food standard and range of facilities available in any given hotel property. The criteria applied within each country will vary depending on the specific requirements established by the relevant issuing body but the outlines below will give a general understanding of what can typically be expected within each category: </p>
            <p><strong>(THESE RATINGS ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE NOT A GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND BY PCOCONNECT)</strong></p>
            <p>Majority will be small, independently owned properties. There is likely to be a limited range of meals and facilities.</p>

            <p>Varying from small to medium sized properties offering more extensive facilities. Reception and staff will aim for a more professional presentation than at one star level and a wider range of services, including food and drink, is likely to be found. Some rooms may be provided with en-suite facilities but this is not guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Hotel properties will usually be of a size to support higher staffing levels and with a greater quality and range of facilities. Reception and public areas will be more spacious. All bedrooms should come with en-suite facilities and room service may be available. </p>
            <p>At this level there should be a noticeable difference in the degree of quality in the furnishings, décor and equipment. Bedrooms are usually more spacious than those found in lower starred properties. Services such as porterage, 24-hour room service, laundry and dry cleaning may be available.</p>
            <p>These properties should provide spacious and luxurious accommodation throughout the hotel. Flawless attention to the guest's requirements should be provided.</p>

            <p>Triple room:<br> Contains twin or double bed/s + extra bed, or two double beds. Most hotels do not have one full size bed for each guest in their triple rooms.</p>
            <p>Twin room for sole use<br>
            Contains two single beds or one double bed in the same room, to be occupied by one person.</p>
            <p>Quad room:<br>
            Contains two double beds or four beds in a room suitable for accommodating four adults.</p>

            <p>7. Apartments and villas. Where this information is available, apartments and villas are graded according to the general standard of the accommodation. However, this grading is not always carried out by an official body, and is not equivalent to standard star ratings used for hotels. Grading (where available) should be regarded as a general guide only. THE GRADINGS ARE FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE NOT A GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND BY PCOCONNECT.</p>
            <p>Grade 1 : acceptable overall level of quality. Adequate provision of furniture, furnishings and fittings.</p>

            <p>Grade 3 : good to very good level of quality. Good standard of maintenance and decoration. Ample space and good quality furniture.</p>
            <p>Grade 4 : excellent overall level of quality. Very good care and attention to detail will be obvious throughout.</p>
            <p>Grade 5 : exceptional overall level of quality. High levels of décor, fixtures and fittings, together with excellent standards of management efficiency and guest services. Excellent range of accessories and personal touches.</p>

            14.Bookings which combine accommodation and other travel arrangements<br>
            <br>
            Bookings that include accommodation and any other travel product fall under the protection of the UAE’s Package Travel Regulations. This means that we accept responsibility for ensuring that your travel arrangements, which you book with us, are supplied as described in this web site. If any part of your travel arrangements are not provided as promised we will pay you appropriate compensation. We also accept responsibility for the acts and/or omissions of our employees, agents and suppliers. <br>
            <br>
            It is unlikely that we will have to make any changes to your travel arrangements, but occasionally, we may have to make changes and we reserve the right to do so at any time. Most of these changes will be minor and we will advise you of them at the earliest possible date. We also reserve the right in any circumstances to cancel your travel arrangements. However, we will not cancel your travel arrangements less than 2 weeks before your departure date, except for reasons beyond our reasonable control or because you have failed to pay the final balance. If we are unable to provide the booked travel arrangements, you can either have a refund of all monies paid except bank charges or service fees or accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements of comparable standard from us, if available. If it is necessary to cancel your travel arrangements, we will pay to you compensation as set out in this clause. <br>
            <br>
            If we make a major change to your holiday, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible if there is time before your departure. <br>
            <br>
            You will have the choice of accepting the change of arrangements, accepting an offer of alternative travel arrangements from us if available or cancelling your booked holiday and receiving a full refund of all monies paid except service fees. In all cases, except where the major change arises due to reasons beyond our reasonable control, we will pay compensation as per our refund policies.</p>
            <p>Tips are not included. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            For services where you have luggage with you, it is your responsibility to ensure that a large enough vehicle is booked to accommodate all luggage. If you bring extra luggage that cannot fit in the vehicle, you will need to cover any additional costs incurred in transferring your luggage.
            For services beginning at airports, stations or ports, it is your responsibility to ensure that you wait for your Driver or Representative at the appointed meeting point as detailed on your voucher. <br>
            <br>
            Should you not be able to locate your Driver or Representative at the start of a service, it is your responsibility to call the relevant telephone number as shown on your Extra Information sheet before making alternative arrangements. <br>
            <br>
            For services beginning from accommodation, please ensure that you are waiting at the appointed meeting point, as shown on your voucher, at least 5 minutes prior to your confirmed pick up time. <br>
            <br>
            Tailor-made sightseeing with a Driver and a Local Guide does not include any entrance fees. Local Guides enter many attractions free of charge, but where you require your Guide to accompany you into an attraction, you may be asked to cover the Guide’s entrance fee as well as your own. <br>
            <br>
            Where available, tailor-made sightseeing may be conducted with a Driver providing the commentary whilst driving. You should note that although drivers are able to give commentary while driving, they may not be able to park the vehicle and accompany you inside specific attractions and they may not be permitted to conduct tours on foot, due to guiding regulations. This option is therefore best suited to visitors looking for a panoramic city tour. <br>
            <br>
            Tailor-made sightseeing should be conducted within the city limits. <br>
            <br>
            For tailor-made sightseeing services you can expect your local guide to have a good overall knowledge of the city sights but if you require exceptionally in-depth commentary on a particular attraction, this may not be possible. <br>
            <br>
            For transfer services where a Local Representative is included in the service, they will assist with check-in as necessary at your accommodation, airport, port or station. <br>
            <br>
            For transfers that include the services of a Driver who speaks either the local or a foreign language, the driver will not assist with check-in at your accommodation or at the airport, port or station unless stated in the extended description for that particular service. <br>
            <br>
            For transfer services where a Local Representative is available at the airport only, they will escort you to your waiting driver who will carry out the rest of the service in your booked vehicle.
            When advising details for the service you wish to book, it is your responsibility to ensure that all details sent to us are correct. <br>
            <br>
            The durations of all transfers are representative of the driving time in average driving conditions. We take no responsibility for a flight, train or other connection being missed should the duration of the service exceed that which we display. <br>
            <br>
            15. Hotel accommodation Price Promise<br>

            <br>
            f) The accommodation at the lower price must be available immediately by an online booking to a retail customer. “On-Request” rooms are excluded. <br>
